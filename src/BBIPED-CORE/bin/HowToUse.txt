-For a parallel or a serial computaions or doing partition no need to change the configuration file
-for writing vtk outputs there are some facilities

	-To visualize just a part of domain you can use:
		PARTIAL_OUT= (BOX,1,2,0,0.4)
	
	the numbers are xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax and optionaly you can add zmin,zmax

	The name of vtk file 	
		EXPORT_VTK_NAME= test

	BBIPED generally periodically write outputs according to (WRT_SOL_FREQ= 500) parameters. If you want just rewrite the last file keep it false otherwise you can set TRUE to have intermediate outputs (Good for unsteady).
		EXPORT_VTK_NAME_WITH_ITR= False

	You can select which quantity appears in output files 
		EXPORT_VTK= (Mach,Lambda2,QCriterion,Density,Pressure,Temperature,Velocity,Total_Pressure)

-For continue a previous run you must set "RESTART_SOL= YES,2000" in configuration file. The BBIPED bypass this parameter and original restart system never invoke. The number is a iteration that you want to start from that.


Parallel use:
	1- mpiexec -np 4 ../../BIPED-Partition 2blades.neu.cfg 
	2- mpiexec -np 4 ../../BIPED-Parallel 2blades.neu.cfg
Serial
	../../BIPED-Serial 2blades.neu.cfg
